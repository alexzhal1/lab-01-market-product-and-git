## Roles and responsibilities

### 1. Mobile Engineer (iOS/Android)

Responsible for developing and maintaining the client-side application that runs on user devices. They implement UI designs, handle user interactions, manage local data storage (caching), and ensure the app performs well across different screen sizes and OS versions. They also integrate with backend APIs.

### 2. DevOps / SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)

Focuses on the infrastructure, deployment pipelines (CI/CD), and system reliability. They configure servers, manage container orchestration (like Kubernetes), set up monitoring and alerting systems (Prometheus, Grafana), and ensure the load balancer correctly distributes traffic to prevent downtime.

### 3. Backend Engineer

Design and build the server-side logic of the application. They write code that processes user requests (e.g., sending a message, logging in), interact with databases, and expose APIs for the mobile app. They are also responsible for optimizing server performance and ensuring code scalability.

### 4. Database Administrator (DBA)

Specializes in data storage performance, integrity, and security. They design database schemas, optimize slow queries, manage backups and replication strategies, and ensure the database can handle high volumes of read/write operations without crashing.

### 5. UI/UX Designer

Responsible for the visual look and feel of the product, as well as the user journey. They create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups for the Mobile Engineer to implement. Their goal is to make the application intuitive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing.

## Common skills across roles

To work effectively in a modern product team, most of these roles share a set of core technical skills:

1. **Git & Version Control**: Every role (even designers in some workflows) must know how to clone repos, commit changes, create branches, and handle merge conflicts to collaborate on the codebase.
2. **Basic Terminal/CLI Usage**: Navigating the file system and running basic scripts via the command line is essential for Engineers, QA, and DevOps.
3. **Understanding of HTTP/REST APIs**: Mobile engineers need to consume them, Backend engineers need to build them, and QAs need to test them. Understanding methods (GET, POST) and status codes (200, 404, 500) is crucial.
4. **Agile Methodologies**: Familiarity with Scrum or Kanban workflows (Jira, Trello), stand-ups, and sprint planning is required for process synchronization.
5. **Documentation Writing**: The ability to write clear technical documentation (like in Markdown) to explain code, APIs, or bug reports to other team members.
